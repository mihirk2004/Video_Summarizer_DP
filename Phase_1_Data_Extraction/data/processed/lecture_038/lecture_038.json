      "text": " Hello everyone, welcome to Neso Academy. In the previous lecture we understood basics of input and output. We learned how to perform basic input output operations with the help of std-c in, std-c out and std-nl. These were the concepts we have understood in the last lecture. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is type conversion in C++. In this lecture we will understand the concept of type conversion. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is introduction to type conversion. First I will introduce you to type conversion, then we will move to the next topic where we will understand implicit type conversion and in the third topic we will understand explicit type conversion. So these are all the topics we will cover in this lecture. Let's start with the first topic that is introduction to type conversion. So what is type conversion? Type conversion refers to the process of changing the data type of a value from one type to the other. So it refers to the process of changing the data type of a specific value to some other type. This is what is called type conversion. I hope this is clear to you. Now we can divide type conversion into two categories. We have implicit type conversion and we have explicit type conversion. These are the two types of type conversions we have in C++. Now our goal of this lecture is to understand implicit and explicit type conversion in great details. For now we are done with the introduction to C++ type conversion. This means we are done with this topic. Now so what is implicit type conversion? Implicit type conversion is the type conversion which is done automatically by the compiler. So it is the type of type conversion which is automatically done by the compiler. We do not have to do anything about it. Here the word implicit refers to something which is not stated clearly or something which is done automatically. So implicit type conversion refers to the type conversion which is done automatically by the compiler. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's move to the second point. The second point is it is also known as automatic type conversion for obvious reasons. Now here comes the third point. It usually happens when different data types are mixed in an expression. So implicit type conversion happens in those situations when we have an expression with different data types. Now one thing we need to understand that an expression can only be evaluated by the compiler if in the expression we have consistent data types that is data types must be same. But if we have an expression with different data types then implicit type conversion can come into picture and with the implicit type conversion it will be possible to convert the data types so that we will be having same data types or consistent data types in an expression. When we have consistent data types in an expression then the expression can be evaluated. So that's the importance of implicit type conversion. This can be done by compiler automatically. I hope this idea is clear to you. If it is not clear I will make this clear to you with the help of an example. Let's understand this statement through an example program. Here in this example program I have included the iostream header file and here I have defined this main function. In this main function I have defined this variable val 1 of type int. Therefore this variable can hold an integer value and it is currently holding this value 10. After this we have this variable val 2 of type double and it is holding this double value 5.6. Here I have written this statement double exp are equal to val 1 plus val 2. Here we have this expression val 1 plus val 2. In place of val 1 we have 10 and in place of val 2 we have 5.6 so we have an integer value and we have a double value. Clearly in this expression we have different types of values. This expression will be evaluated later and the result will be stored in exp are and here with the help of stdc out I am trying to display this result which is stored in exp are but before that I am also printing this message result colon. So clearly when we execute this program we will get this output result colon 15.6. We are getting the result as 15.6. This means the expression has been evaluated and we already know that the expression can only be evaluated when we have consistent data types. When the data types are same here the data types are different. In this case there is the possibility that implicit type conversion comes into picture. This means implicit type conversion will be performed by the compiler. Now what happens in case of implicit type conversion as this is the type conversion clearly one value out of these two will be converted to some other type. Here we have an integer value and here we have a double value. Either the integer value will be converted to double value or double value will be converted to integer value. In this way we will get consistent data types in this expression and then the expression can be evaluated. Now my question is which value will be converted to the other type. This is decided by the C++ compiler and C++ compiler converts lower data type to higher data type to avoid data loss. So C++ converts lower data type to higher data type. Out of these two one is the lower data type value. One type will be converted to the other and in this way we will get consistent data type values. So we need to remember this rule that C++ compiler converts on its own lower data type to higher data type and this is mainly done to avoid data loss. You will get to know about why I am saying that it will avoid data loss in a moment. But for now we need to understand what is the meaning of lower data type and what is the meaning of higher data type and how C++ compiler decides which type is lower and which type is higher. So that's the question how C++ decides lower and higher data types. C++ decides this based on the size or range and precision of the data types. By C++ I mean C++ compiler. I may address C++ compiler as C++. So C++ decides lower data type and higher data type based on the size or range and precision. These are the two parameters. Based on these two we can form this hierarchy of data types. Here we can observe that bold data type is less than any other data type. So clearly it is the lowest data type in this hierarchy. Also we can observe that long double is greater than any other data type. So clearly this is the highest data type in this hierarchy. Now why it is the case? It is because of range or size and precision. So these are the two parameters based on which we can form this hierarchy. Now let's try to understand this properly. Here we have this bold data type. Bold data type has the size of one byte and with bold data type we can represent only two values. There is no other data type in this list that can represent just two values. So clearly bold data type is less than any other data type. That's why it is first in this hierarchy. So clearly bold data type is the lowest data type then comes the CAR data type. CAR data type has the size of one byte but it is still greater than bold data type because it can represent much wider range of values compared to bold. With bold we can represent only two values. With CAR data type we can represent values from 0 to 255 or minus 128 to 127. Clearly it has the wider range therefore based on the range CAR data type is greater than bold data type. What about short? The size of short is two bytes. Clearly it is greater than CAR based on the size. What about int? Int is greater than short because int is four bytes long. What about long? Long can be four bytes or eight bytes. That depends on the system or we can say the platform. But in general sense we can say long can represent much wider range of values if we compare it with int. If the size of long is four bytes then it is same as int therefore it can represent the same number of values as int but if the size of long is eight bytes then it can represent much wider range of values. Therefore we can say long is greater than int based on the range and of course the size as well. Now what about float? We know that size of long can be four bytes or eight bytes but when we talk about float size of float must be four bytes only. So it can have only four bytes size but still I am saying that float is greater than long. Why is this the case? Here size or range is not playing any role. Precision is playing the role. By precision I mean in this case that float can represent much more precise values compared to long. With long we can only represent integers but with float we can represent real numbers. Much more precise values compared to integer. Therefore the range of float is much wider compared to long so clearly float is greater than long that too based on precision. What about double? Double is greater than float because double is of size eight bytes and float is of size four bytes. What about long double? Long double can be eight, twelve or sixteen bytes long. If we compare it with double of course it is greater than double. So this is the hierarchy that we are getting. Now we know which type is lower and which type is higher. This hierarchy is also called the type promotion hierarchy. Why are we calling this type promotion hierarchy? For this we need to understand the meaning of type promotion first. Type promotion refers to the conversion of lower data type to higher data type. It is just like promoting lower data type to higher data type. So there is the promotion of type that's why we call it type promotion. Now why are we calling this hierarchy type promotion hierarchy? The reason is simple. From this hierarchy we can deduce which type is lower and which type is higher and we can also understand how the type promotion can happen. Which type will be promoted to the higher data type? We can observe this from this hierarchy. That's why we call this type promotion hierarchy. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's pick one example from here. If we compare int with double, clearly int is the lower data type compared to double. So we can convert int to double or we can promote int to double. But double cannot be converted to int. This will lead to data loss. Why am I saying data loss? Because double can represent much more precise values with decimal point. If we convert it to integer, then definitely we will lose data. That is we will lose data after the decimal point. So clearly int can be converted to double, but double cannot be converted to int. Now I hope it is clear to you as well that why c++ converts lower data type to higher data type. The reason is simple. It avoids data loss. C++ converts lower data type to higher data type to avoid data loss. Here this integer value will be converted implicitly to double. So it will get converted to its equivalent double value. And now we have two double values. We can add them. This will be evaluated and this will give us the result 15.6. Now I hope it is clear to you why are we getting this result and not the error. There is implicit type conversion going on behind the scenes. So with this we have understood the concept of implicit type conversion. This means we are done with the second topic also. Now let's move to the third topic where we will understand the explicit type conversion. So what is explicit type conversion? Explicit type conversion is the type conversion which is done manually by the programmer. As the name itself suggests, explicit refers to something that is stated clearly or something which is done manually. So clearly explicit type conversion means a type conversion which is done manually by the programmer. Now here comes the second point. It is used when we want full control over data type conversion. When we want complete control over the conversion of data type, then we can use explicit type conversion. We have different methods available to do this. We have a total of three different methods that allow us to do explicit type conversion. We have named casts, cast notation and function notation. Named casts is something that we will understand later in this course. Precisely when we will properly understand inheritance and polymorphism, then we will understand the concept of named casts. Named casts will be clear after that. So after discussion of inheritance and polymorphism, we will learn named casts. Now we will focus on cast notation and function notation. Let's first understand cast notation. Cast notation is the notation which is followed in C programming language for type conversion. So if we want to do explicit type conversion, we can do with the help of cast notation. It is inherited from C programming language. The second point is it is also called C style type conversion for obvious reasons. Now let's take one example program to C cast notation in action. Here I have included IO stream header file. In this main function, I have defined this variable pi of type double and to this I have provided this value 3.14159. Here I am doing the type conversion. This is the type conversion which is done by me, the programmer. This is explicit type conversion. Precisely here I am following cast notation for converting the type of this value to in teacher. We know that variable pi is holding this double value. Here in these parentheses, I have provided int. Providing int means I want to convert this value to in teacher. So double will be converted to in teacher. Higher data type will be converted to lower data type. Clearly there will be data loss. We will get 3 only from here. Point 14159 will be deleted or truncated. We will get value 3 in this variable aprox and here with the help of STDC out, I am printing the value of aprox. First, aprox value of pi will be printed and then the value. So when we execute this program, we will get this output. Aprox value of pi 3. I hope this is clear to you. So this is the cast notation. This is followed in C programming language. Within parentheses, we need to specify the data type. Now let's move to the function notation. Function notation uses function like notation for type conversion. It looks like a function. That's why we call it function like notation or function notation. It is also called old C++ style type conversion because it is followed in old C++ that is before C++ 11. It is not followed right now in this modern C++. Now through an example program, let's understand how to use function notation. Here I am going to take the same example program which we took in cast notation. Here I have used the cast notation. Now we can replace this with function notation. For this, we can remove these parentheses and we can place parentheses around pi. Here we will get this type of notation. You can observe that this is int and then pi within parentheses. This is the function notation. You can observe it looks like a function call. That's why this is called the function notation. Here also we will get the same output because this value will be converted to its equivalent integer form and we will get this output. So with this, we have learned the function notation as well. We have learned two different notations for doing type conversion on our own. Now we are done with explicit type conversion but there is one important point I want you to understand. In modern C++ that is C++ 11 or later, the cast notation and function notation are discouraged. We do not use cast notation and function notation in C++ 11 or later. That is, we do not use these two notations in modern C++ because they lack safety and readability. We will understand why it is the case later when we discuss named casts. For now, just understand that in modern C++ we do not use cast notation and function notation. So what's the solution for explicit type conversion? What are we left with? We are left with named casts. This is what we will understand in our upcoming lectures. We will understand when we discuss inheritance and polymorphism as I have already mentioned this. So with this, we are done with explicit type conversion as well and this means we are done with this topic and we are done with this lecture too. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one.",
