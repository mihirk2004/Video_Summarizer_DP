      "text": " Hello everyone, welcome to NISO Academy. In the previous lectures, we understood the basics of data types. The last lecture was about finding the range of integer data type. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is Fundamental Data Types. In this lecture, we will understand some of the fundamental data types available in C++. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is Introduction to Data Types. First, I will introduce you to data types. I will explain what are the different data types we have. Then we will move to the next topic where we will understand fundamental data types in great details. So these are the two topics we have in this lecture. Let's get started with the first topic that is Introduction to Data Types. So what is a data type? We already know this that a data type tells the type and size of data a variable can hold. So with data type, we can tell the type and size of data a variable is capable of holding. That's what data type is. We learned about data type already. Now let's understand what are the different data types we have in C++. We have fundamental data types. Fundamental data types are built in data types. That is, these data types are predefined. We do not have to define these data types and they also set the core of other data types like classes, enums, pointers, arrays etc. That is why they are called fundamental data types. Under fundamental data types, we have int, care, float, double, bool and void. These are all the fundamental data types. We will discuss these data types in details in the next topic. For now, just understand these are the fundamental data types we have. Then we have user defined data types. These are the data types which are defined by user or programmer as the name suggests. Under this category, we have struct, class, enum and union. Then we have derived data types. Derived data types are those data types which are derived from fundamental data types. That's why they are called derived data types. Now under this category, we have arrays, pointers, functions and references. So you can observe these are the different data types we have and the focus of this lecture is on fundamental data types as already mentioned. So we will understand these data types in the next topic. For now, we are done with the introduction to data types. Now let's move to the second topic where we will understand fundamental data types in great details. Here is the first fundamental data type, int. Int is used to represent integers. We already know this that int is helpful in representing an integer. Here is the size of int. Size of int is 4 bytes that is 32 bits. And with the help of int, we can have this range minus 2147483648 to plus 2147483647. This is the range we have obtained from this formula. This formula we have already started in the last lecture. In the last lecture, I explained how to find the range of an integer type. Especially for signed integer type, we have this range minus 2 power n minus 1 to plus 2 power n minus 1 minus 1. We also learned how to find the unsigned range. We have 0, 2, 2 power n minus 1 as the unsigned range. By default, int data type is signed. That's why we have this signed range. By signed, I mean we would be able to represent both positive and negative values. Here we are representing both positive and negative values. Here we need to use this formula. We need to replace n by 32 here and here and then we will get this specific range. I hope this is clear to you. So with this, we learned this int data type. But this is not the only data type we have to represent an integer. We have other integer types as well. Now let's discuss them one by one through this table. Here in this table, I will list down the types. Then I will provide the sizes of each type and I will also provide the range of each type. Here is the first type, short int. The size of short int is 2 bytes and therefore the range is minus 32768 to 32767. We can use the same formula here. Now we need to replace n by 16 because we have 2 bytes as the size for short int. 2 bytes is same as 16 bits. That's why we need to replace n by 16 here and here to get this range. Again, short int is also signed by default. That's why we are using this formula. I hope this is clear to you. Now here comes the second type. The second type is int. We learned already what int is. Long int has 4 bytes of size and ranges minus 2147483648 to 2147483647. We can use the same formula. Then comes the long int type. Long int type has size of 4 bytes or 8 bytes. That depends on the platform and the compiler. In 32-bit systems, long int has the 4 bytes size. This is fixed. But in 64-bit systems, it can be 4 bytes or 8 bytes. That depends on the platform. Mostly on Windows machine, long int has the 4 bytes size. On Unix-based machines, it is of 8 bytes. I hope this is clear to you. If we are considering 4 bytes long int, then the range must be same as the int data type. I hope this is clear to you. Again, this is also representing signed long int. Now here comes the 4th data type. That is long long int. Long long int has the fixed size of 8 bytes. 8 bytes is same as 64 bits. If we replace 64 here and here, we will get this range. Minus 2 power 63 to plus 2 power 63 minus 1. 2 power 63 will give us a very big value. I hope it is clear to you. So these are the 4 integer data types we have. Precisely, these are signed integer types. That's why we have these signed ranges. We can also represent them in unsigned form. That is, we can have unsigned versions of these types. This means we have 4 more data types which are associated with integers. We have unsigned short int. We just need to specify the unsigned keyword to tell that we want to represent only positive numbers. Unsigned short int has the same size of 2 bytes and the range is 0 to 65535. We can get this range by using the formula 0 to 2 power n minus 1. We can replace n by 16. We will get 2 power 16. 2 power 16 is same as 65,536. Then we need to subtract 1 from it to obtain 65,535 here. So we will get this range 0 to 65,535. As mentioned already, this is the unsigned type. Therefore, we can only represent positive values with it. Now let's move to the other type. The next type, the next type is unsigned int. Unsigned int has the same size as int but it can represent only unsigned values. That is positive values, sizes 4 bytes and ranges 0 to 4 to 9, 4, 9, 6, 7 to 9, 5. I obtained this range by using the same formula. Now here comes the next type that is unsigned long int. Unsigned long int can be 4 bytes or 8 bytes. If we are considering 4 byte unsigned long int, then the range must be same as unsigned int which is 0, 2, 4, 9, 4, 9, 6, 7 to 9, 5. Last but not the least, we have unsigned long long int. Size of it is same as the long long int which is 8 bytes. But the range is of course different. Here we will have 0, 2, 2 power 64 minus 1. I hope this is clear to you. So with this we have learned different integer types we have in C++. Now let's take one simple example of the integer variable. Here I have defined this integer variable. This variable name is i and the type here is int. We can specify any other type which is of integer. And here I have provided this value 2, 1, 4, 7, 4, 8, 3, 6, 4, 7. This is the maximum possible value we can provide to this variable as you can observe this here. We can provide the minimum possible value if we want. We can provide minus 2, 1, 4, 7, 4, 8, 3, 6, 4, 8. This variable is of type int. Therefore it can hold these values. So with this I hope it is clear to you what is the int data type. What are the different integer types we have. Now let's move to the second fundamental data type which is the CAD data type. CAD data type is used to represent characters enclosed within single codes. We know what a character is. A character is a single character which can be enclosed within single codes. Size of CAD data type is 1 byte that is 8 bits and its range is minus 128 to 127. If we are considering signed CAD. If we are considering unsigned CAD then the range must be 0 to 255. Now you might be wondering why are we having integer ranges here. The reason is clear. We know that internal representation of a character is integer. So we can think of CAD data type as another integer type. This is just another integer type. That's why we can specify these integer ranges. CAD data type has the size of 1 byte that is 8 bits. With 8 bits we can have these ranges. If we have the CAD data type then it is possible to store integers in this range. If let's say we have unsigned CAD then the range is 0 to 255. So we can represent these positive values if we want. So it is possible to directly store an integer in a character type variable. I hope this idea is clear to you. We can store a character if we want. That character will be translated to an integer. We know each character has an integer equivalent. You can search online for an ASCII table and there you will find all the characters written and their integer equivalents. So this is something I want to clear. I want to mention one more important point that it is not the case that by default CAD data type is signed. It depends on the compiler. It may be possible that one compiler has the signed CAD as the default and the other compiler has the unsigned CAD as the default. If we want we can impose signed CAD or unsigned CAD by specifying the keywords signed or unsigned before the CAD data type. I hope this idea is clear. Now let's take one example of the character variable. Here I have defined this variable C of type CAR and to this variable I have provided this specific character capital P. This will eventually be translated to its integer equivalent. I want you to find out what is the integer equivalent of capital P by looking at the ASCII table. You can search online for the ASCII table ASCII double I. I hope this is clear to you. I really want you to post your answers in the comment section. What is the integer equivalent of capital P? Now we are done with the second data type also. Let's move to the third fundamental data type which is the float data type. Float data type is used to represent a floating point number with precision up to 7 decimal digits. So with the help of float data type it is possible to represent a floating point number that is a number with the decimal point and it provides the precision up to 7 decimal digits. So if we have a number with 7 decimal digits that is 7 digits after the decimal point and if we try to store the value in the variable then that value will be intact. It will not change. This means after the decimal point 7 decimal digits will not change. But let's say we have more than 7 digits then after the 7th digit it is possible that we may lose precision. We may not get those same values. This is the meaning of precision. I hope this is clear to you. So with float we get 7 decimal digits precision. Here is the size of the float data type. It has 4 bytes size that is 32 bits. And the range is mentioned here. Range of the float data type is 1.17549 e-38 to 3.40282 e-38. We already know the meaning of e-38 and e-38. This is same as 1.17549 times 10 to the power minus 38. And this is same as 3.40282 times 10 to the power 38. I hope this is clear to you. This is the range of positive values. We can provide the range of negative values as well by placing minus sign in front of these two values. So we will get this range. Minus 1.17549 e-38 to minus 3.40282 e plus 38. So these are the ranges we get for the float type. I hope this is clear to you. Now you might be wondering how do we get this range? How can we calculate these ranges? We know how to calculate the range of an int type. That is integer type. But how can we calculate the range of the float type? This is out of the scope of this C++ course. Understand that calculating the range of the float type or double type which we will discuss later is out of the scope of this C++ course because it is usually taught in computer organization and architecture subject. There you will understand all about the floating point numbers, the IEEE 754 standard and there you will understand how a floating point number is represented. You will also learn about how to calculate the range of floating point numbers. So floating point numbers can be well understood in the computer organization and architecture subject. Here we just need to see this what is the range of the float type. We do not have to worry about how these ranges we can get. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's take one example of the float variable. Here I have defined this float variable F and to this I have provided this value 6.53F. This is the float literal. Now we know what is the float data type. Let's move to the fourth data type which is the double data type. Double data type is used to represent a floating point number with precision up to 15 decimal digits. Here we get 15 decimal digits precision which is twice as much of the float. Here you can observe we get the precision up to 7 decimal digits. Here we get the precision up to 15 decimal digits. So if we have a floating point number with 15 decimal digits then we will get those 15 decimal digits as it is. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's see what is the size of the double. Size of double is 8 bytes which is double the size of the float. You can observe this. That's why the name double I hope this is clear to you. We get the double precision because we have double the size. Now what's the range? Ranges 2.22507e-308 to 1.79769e-308. Range is very big compared to float. This is what you can observe. This is the range of positive values for negative values. We need to place minus sign in front of these two values. We will get this range. Now here is a simple example. I have defined this variable of type double. The name of this variable is D and the value I have provided is 56e-5. I can store this value. So this is the double type. I hope this type is also clear to you. Up to this point we have studied four fundamental data types. Now let's move to the fifth fundamental data type which is the bold type. Bold type represents truth values, true and false. So with the help of bold type it is possible to represent only two values that is true and false. Size of bold type is 1 byte that is 8 bits but it can only represent two values that is true and false. And here is the example of the bold type variable. I have defined this variable of type bool and I have provided true to it. I can also provide false if I want to. One thing we need to note that bold type is used mainly for conditionals and loops. We will learn about conditionals and loops later where you will understand the significance of the bold type. Now let's move to the sixth fundamental data type which is the void data type. Void indicates absence of data or no value. So it represents some emptiness or absence of data. We do not use it to define a variable. No variable can have a void type because it does not make sense. A variable must hold some value. We cannot define a variable as void. But we can use void data type in other scenarios. We can use it for functions. If we want we can specify the return type as void of a function to indicate that function will not return anything. That is it will not produce any output but it may perform some action. For example here I have defined this function fun and the return type of this function is void. This means this function will not return any value. This is one use case of the void data type. There are other use cases as well. We will study about them later. We mainly use void data type for functions and pointers. We will learn about pointers as well. So with this we have understood six fundamental data types in C++. We learned about int, care, float, double, bool and void. These are the fundamental data types. Now we are done with the second topic also. And this means we are done with this lecture. Okay friends this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one. Bye.",
