      "text": " Hello everyone, welcome to Neso Academy. We have already completed chapter number 3, Operators in C++. Now we are in chapter number 4 and the name of this chapter is Control Structures and Functions. In this chapter we will understand different types of control structures. Apart from this, we will also understand the concept of functions in details. We are beginning this chapter with this lecture and the name of this lecture is If Else Statement. This is one of the control structure we need to understand. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic of this lecture is the If Else Statement. First we will properly understand the If Else Statement. Then we will move to the second topic to understand the If Else If Letter. After understanding this topic, we will move to the third topic to understand the Nested If Else Statement. So these are the topics of this lecture. Let's start with the first topic, the If Else Statement. So what is the If Else Statement? The If Else Statement is the statement that allows us to execute a statement based on the condition. If the condition turns out to be true, then a specific statement will execute, otherwise some other statement will execute. So that's the control structure If Else Statement and this is how it works. It executes a statement based on some condition. To understand this properly, let's consider the syntax of the If Else Statement. This is the syntax we need to follow. Here we have If and Else. We can observe we have parentheses and within parentheses, we need to specify the condition. Now if this condition is true, then statement one will execute. That is the statement following If will execute, otherwise the statement following Else will execute. That is the statement two will execute. We can read it like this. If condition is true, then execute statement one, otherwise or else execute statement two. This is quite simple. Now let's implement this behavior through an example program. Here I have included the IO stream header file because I'm using stdc out inside the main function. We have the variable marks defined in this function. This variable is of type integer and this is holding value 55. Now here we have this If Else construct or we can say If Else statement. Here I'm checking this condition. Is marks greater than 50? If marks is greater than 50, then this statement will execute. This means we will get the output you passed the exam on the screen. If at all it is the case that marks is less than or equal to 50, that means this condition is not true, then the Else structure will execute. This means the statement will execute and we will get the output you failed the exam. Now we know this marks variable is holding value 55. Therefore this condition is true and hence you passed the exam will be displayed on the screen. I hope this is clear to you how this program works. Now we know the exact meaning of If Else and how it works. Here you might have observed that we have just one statement after If and Else. This is because we are following this syntax and according to this syntax we are allowed to include only a single statement after If and Else. That's the point. Only a single statement is allowed. This is according to the syntax. But what if we want to execute multiple statements based on a condition? We can do that too. We need to do a trick in this case. We need to form a compound statement. A compound statement is a statement which has multiple statements and we can form a compound statement with the help of braces. So clearly if we want to form a compound statement we need to enclose multiple statements within braces. That's what I have written. So the syntax looks like this. If we want to include multiple statements inside If and Else, then we need to put them within braces. Within these braces we can specify as many statements as we want. This is one compound statement. It is treated as a single statement. So we are not breaking the rule of the If and Else. Here inside this If we can include as many statements as possible because we are enclosing the statements within braces. Similarly within Else also we can include as many statements as we want because we are enclosing all the statements within braces. I hope this idea is clear to you. Now let's implement this idea. Here I am taking the same example with some modifications. Here instead of printing just one message, I also want to print congratulations. For this purpose we need these two stdc out statements and I am putting these two statements within braces. Therefore I am forming a compound statement. Now this compound statement is part of If. If this condition is true, then these two statements will execute. Otherwise this statement will execute. Here you can observe that after Else we just have one statement. So this statement is part of Else and according to the syntax, this is allowed. We do not have to place braces over here although we can. Now when we execute this program, we will get the output you passed the exam. Congratulations because the marks variable is still holding the value 55. I would also like to mention that the Else part is actually optional. So if we want we can remove this from here. We will still get the same output because marks variable is holding value 55 and in this case only this If block will execute. But what if the value the marks variable is holding is less than 50 or if it is equal to 50. In that case we will not get any output on the screen because there is no Else block and there is no statement following the If. I hope this concept is clear to you. So if we include Else then we know that we would be able to execute some statements when the condition turns out to be false. If the Else is not included then there will be no statements to execute when the condition turns out to be false. I hope this is clear to you. So with this we have understood the If Else statement properly. This means we are done with the first topic. Now let's move to the second topic to understand the If Else If letter. We have already learned that with the help of If Else statement we can check a specific condition and execute a statement based on the condition. Now what if we want to check multiple conditions then we can use something called If Else If letter. If Else If letter allows us to check multiple conditions and based on those conditions we can execute a couple of statements. Now here is the syntax we can follow. According to this syntax we first need to specify the If condition. Here is condition 1. If this condition 1 is true then statement 1 will execute which is part of If. Otherwise we need to check condition 2. Here we have Else and If. If this condition turns out to be false then we will move to this specific block and we will check condition 2. If condition 2 is true then statement 2 will execute otherwise we will go to the next Else If block. There we need to check condition 3, then condition 4, then condition 5. In this way we can continue and follow this If Else If letter. At the end we have the Else block. Now this will execute when no other condition is true. So that's the concept. This is the If Else If letter. Now let's consider one example to properly understand how to use If Else If letter. Here is the example program. In this main function I have defined variable score with value 85 and here is the If Else If letter. I want to check multiple conditions that's why I have included If Else If letter here. Now here I am checking this condition. Is score greater than or equal to 90? If score is greater than or equal to 90 then sdc out statement will execute and it will display grade A on the screen. So if someone has scored marks greater than or equal to 90 then the grade will be A. Otherwise if score is greater than or equal to 80 then grade B will be displayed. Now understand what does this mean? We know that if the score is not greater than or equal to 90 then this means we need to move to this specific Else If. If the score is not greater than or equal to 90 then it must be less than 90. This is one thing that is true. Now if this condition is true then the score must be greater than or equal to 80 and it must be less than 90. So indeed we are checking two conditions at the same time here and based on this grade B will be displayed on the screen. If at all this condition is not satisfied then we are sure that the score is less than 80. In that case this Else block will execute and therefore grade F will be displayed on the screen. So we know what happens when we execute this program. Here we have value 85 in the score variable. This value is less than 90 but it is greater than 80. Therefore grade B will be displayed on the screen. So with this I hope it is clear to you what is if Else If letter and how to use it in C++ program. So with this we have understood the second topic also. Now let's move to the third topic to understand the nested if else statement. So what's the concept of the nested if else statement and why do we use it? We have understood how to check multiple conditions that too with the help of if Else if letter. But we know that a specific condition will only be checked when the condition preceding it turns out to be false. Now what if we want to check a specific condition when the condition preceding it is true? In this case we can use nested if else statement. Nested if else statement allows us to check one condition inside another condition. This can be understood through the syntax. Here is the syntax of the nested if else statement. If condition one is true then only condition two will be checked. If condition two is true then statement one will execute. If condition two turns out to be false then statement two will execute. If at all it is the case that condition one itself is false then condition two will not be checked. In that case this else block will execute and this means statement three will be executed. I hope this is clear to you. Now let's implement this behavior through an example program. Let's consider a scenario for this purpose. Let's say we want to design a program for an ATM machine. Now the requirement is that the ATM machine must check whether the card inserted by the user is working properly or not. If the card is working properly then we will compare the amount that the user wants to transact with the balance of the account. We will check whether the amount is less than or equal to balance or not. If at all it is the case that amount is less than or equal to balance then the transaction will be successful. We will display the message appropriately on the screen. Otherwise we will display that there is no sufficient balance to deduct the amount that you want to. Now if it is the case that the card is not working properly then we will not compare amount with the balance. Instead we will display some error message on the screen to let user know about this. Now let's write the program for the same. This is how the program looks like. Here inside this main function I have defined variables, balance and amount. Variable balance is holding value 10,000 and amount is holding 5000. I am assuming that the amount user wants to transact is 5000 and the account has the balance 10,000. Let us suppose that we have the variable card working which is used to check whether the card is working or not and here I am assuming that the card is working therefore this Boolean variable is holding value true. Now here we are checking this specific condition. Is card working? This means we are checking whether the card is working or not. We know that card working is true therefore this condition is true. If this condition is true then we know that the code within this if will execute. Here we have this specific block. We have this compound statement. Here we have another if else and here we are checking is amount less than or equal to balance. We know the amount user wants to transact is less than the balance. Therefore this statement will execute and transaction success will be displayed on the screen. If it is the case that the amount is not less than or equal to balance then the else block will execute and insufficient balance will be displayed. Now if the card is not working then this message will be displayed on the screen that is card error. So I hope this program is clear to you and now we know what's going to be the output for this program. The output is transaction success because the amount is less than the balance and card is also working properly. So we have written the program which demonstrates clearly how to use the nested if well statement and what is its use. So with this we have understood the last topic as well that is the nested if well statement and this means we are done with all the topics of this lecture. Okay friends this is it for now. Thank you for watching this lecture. I will see you in the next one.",
