      "text": " Hello everyone, welcome to Nesoo Academy. In the previous lectures we have understood if else and switch statements. Those were the control structures and we know with the help of these statements we can check a specific condition and based on the condition we can execute a block of code. Now we are in this lecture and the name of this lecture is Loops in C++. This is also a type of a control structure which we will study in this lecture. So without any further delay, let's get started with this lecture and let's see what are the topics. The first topic is introduction to Loops. First I will introduce you to the world of Loops. Then we will understand the for loop, the while loop and the do while loop. So these are the topics of this lecture. Let's start with the first one that is introduction to Loops. So what are Loops? A loop is something that allows us to repeat a block of code multiple times. With the help of a loop, we can repeat a block of code as many times as we want and that too without putting in much manual effort from our side. To understand the significance of a loop, let's consider one scenario. Let's say we want to display the message hello on the screen that too 10 times. Now if we have no idea about a loop, then we may choose to write the code like this. We will write the stdc out statement 10 times to display hello on the screen. Now we know with the help of this code, hello will be displayed 10 times. But is this approach an efficient approach? No, right? This approach is not efficient because we need to write the same statement multiple times. If at all we need to print hello on the screen 100 times, then we need to write the stdc out statement 100 times. This is not at all an efficient approach. This requires a lot of manual effort from our side. Therefore, it is important to have a construct that allows us to repeat a block of code and loop is here for the rescue. We can convert this block of code to its equivalent for loop like this. This is one type of a loop called the for loop. We will study the syntax of the for loop properly later in this lecture. For now, just understand that with the help of this for loop, we would be able to print hello on the screen 10 times because here we have specified the value 10. Now the beauty of this for loop is that if we want to display the message hello 100 times, then we just need to replace 10 by 100 and the job is done. So this loop will take care of printing hello 100 times on the screen if we provide 100 in place of 10 here. So clearly, this code is much efficient. It requires less manual effort from our side and therefore it is a great replacement for the code that we have written over here. So I hope with this the significance of a loop is clear to you. Now let's see what are the different types of loops we have. In C++, we have three types of loops in C++. We have the for loop, the while loop and the do while loop. We will study these three different types of loops in this lecture. For now, we are done with the introduction to loops. This means we are done with the first topic. Let's move to the second topic to understand the for loop properly. Now what is the for loop? For loop is the loop that allows us to execute a code block that too based on some condition. So there is the conditional execution. Based on some condition the code block will execute and it is the case that first the condition is checked and then the code block will execute. This means if the condition is true, then only the code block will execute and it will continue to execute because this is a loop. Now for loop is mainly used in those situations when the number of iterations are known in advance. If we already know how many times we need to repeat a block of code, then we can use the for loop because for loop is mainly used in those situations when we already know the number of repetitions or we can say number of iterations before hand. I hope this idea is clear to you. So now let's take one simple example to understand how to use the for loop in C++ programs. Here I have written the program. Here with the help of this program we can display hello 10 times on the screen. Here I have written the for loop for the same purpose. Now let's understand how this for loop works. First we need to specify the for keyword. Within parentheses we can specify three things. First we can specify the initialization statement. This is the initialization statement because here we are initializing this variable i with value 1. Then after this we can provide the conditional expression. Here we have the condition i less than or equal to 10 and lastly we can provide the update expression. Here I have provided i++. This means i will be incremented by 1 every time. Within braces we can provide the code which we want to repeat. Here I have provided this line of code because I want to display hello a certain number of times. Now let's understand how this for loop works. First the initialization statement will execute. This means i is initialized to 1. Then the condition is checked. We know 1 is less than 10. Therefore this condition is true. Now the update expression will not execute. This is not the sequence followed by the for loop. After checking the condition the body of the loop will execute. This is the body of the loop within braces. Here we have just a single statement. This statement will execute after checking the condition. We know the condition is true. Therefore this statement will execute and we will see hello for the first time on the screen. Then after this i++ will be evaluated. So that's the flow. Initialization, condition, then loop body execution and then the update expression. Now i++ will happen. This means i is incremented by 1. We know the current value of i is 1. Now it becomes 2. Now again the condition will be checked. This means we will compare 2 and 10. We know 2 is less than 10. Therefore this condition is true. As this condition is true the loop body will execute once again and this means hello will be displayed for the second time. Again i++ will happen. i becomes 3. Now 3 is compared with 10. 3 is less than 10. Therefore this statement will execute once again and we will see hello for the third time. In this way the process continues until i becomes 11. When i becomes 11 this condition becomes false and because this condition is false we will get outside of this for loop. So this is how this for loop works. We will get this output on the screen because this loop executes 10 times. i is initialized to 1 and here we are checking i less than or equal to 10. Clearly this loop runs from 1 to 10. This means this loop runs 10 times and that's why we are seeing this message 10 times. So with this we have understood how the for loop can be used in C++ programs. With the help of the for loop we can repeat a statement or a set of statements a certain number of times. We mainly use the for loop when the number of iterations are known in advance. Here we already know how many times we want to repeat this statement. That's why we can use the for loop. So with this we have understood the concept of the for loop. This means we are done with the second topic also. Now let's move to the third topic to understand the while loop. Now what is the while loop? The while loop is the loop that allows us to execute a block of code based on some condition just like for loop. And it checks the condition first and then it executes the code block. So it works exactly the same like the for loop. But there is one difference. We mainly use the while loop when the number of iterations are not known in advance. So functionality wise for loop and while loop are same. They work exactly the same. But we mainly use the while loop when the number of iterations are not known to us at the time of writing the code. When we know the number of iterations beforehand, then it is advisable to use the for loop. Although we can use the while loop as well. But it is advisable to use the for loop because for loop is more readable and understandable in this case. When we do not know the number of iterations beforehand, then it is advisable to use the while loop. I hope this is clear to you. Also I want to mention this that because the functionality of the for loop and the while loop are same, we can convert a for loop to its equivalent while loop and we can also convert a while loop to its equivalent for loop. This can be done. So the for loop we have written before can easily be converted to its equivalent while loop. Now let's see how to do this. Here I took the same example program. We have this for loop which we know runs 10 times and therefore the message hello will be displayed 10 times. Now we can easily convert this for loop to its equivalent while loop. For this purpose, first we need to move this initialization statement to the top. Now we have the initialization statement over here. Then we need to shift this update expression at the end of the body of the loop. So now i++ comes here just before this closing brace. Now we just have this condition within parentheses. Here we need to replace this for by the keyword while and that's it. We have obtained the equivalent while loop. I hope this is clear to you. This while loop works exactly the same as the for loop which we saw before. There's only the structural difference. Here the initialization will happen. It happens only once just like for loop. After this the condition is checked. If this condition is true then the loop body will execute just like the for loop. And of course the update expression will execute after executing this line of code. Then after this the condition is checked once again. If this condition is again true then this statement will execute once again and the update expression will also execute. So functionality wise both for loop and while loop are same. There is only the structural difference between the two. For these type of situations it is advisable to use the for loop because we would be able to see initialization statement, conditional expression and update expression in the same line. Therefore it is easier to manage them and read them. In situations when we don't know the number of iterations beforehand we use the while loop. Here I have demonstrated that we can easily convert a for loop to a while loop. And we can use while loop in those situations as well when the number of iterations are known to us. Now we know what's the output. We will get the same output. We will get hello 10 times on the screen. I hope this is completely clear to you. Now let's justify this point. Here I have written we use while loop and the number of iterations are not known in advance. Let's take an example for the same. Let us suppose we want to ask the user to enter a choice. It can be y or n. y means yes and n means no. If the choice is y then the loop will execute and therefore the user will be asked again to enter the choice. If the choice is n then we will exit the loop and some message will be displayed on the screen. Now here we can observe that the number of iterations we do not know beforehand because we don't know what is entered by the user. So clearly here we do not know the number of iterations and therefore it is advisable to use the while loop in this situation. Let's use the one. Here I have written the code to ask the user to provide a choice and based on the choice the while loop will execute. Here you can observe that I have defined variable choice of typecar and here I have written these two statements to ask the user a choice and receive the choice. Now here I have written the while loop. The condition is choice not equal to n. If choice entered by the user is not equal to n then the loop will continue and execute these two statements. This means we will again ask the user to enter the choice. If the choice turns out to be n then this condition becomes false and we will exit the while loop. In this case this statement will be displayed. We will get this message exit. Now let's execute this program. Here you can observe we got enter your choice y or n. Let's enter y and let's press the enter button. We would be able to see this message once again because of this while loop. As this condition is true these two statements will execute once again. Now let's provide y once again and let's hit enter. We will get the same message. This time let's provide n. Now when we hit enter we know that this condition is false and therefore this message will be displayed next. I hope this program is completely clear to you. From this program we can observe how we can use the while loop when the number of iterations are not known to us at the time of writing the code. Now here is the quick exercise for you. As I have already mentioned this we can convert a for loop to its equivalent while loop and we can do the vice versa as well. I really want you to convert this while loop to its equivalent for loop. Here is the hint for you. We do not have to specify the initialization statement and the update expression because they are optional. I want you to do this exercise and I want you to post your answers in the comment section as well after completion of this lecture. Now let's get back to this lecture. Here we have written these two statements to ask the user a choice and to receive the choice in the variable choice. And you can observe these two statements are repeated over here as well. So there is the repetition. Whenever we have a repetition in the code it is advisable to optimize the code to reduce the repetition because repetition is not good. We must always try to reduce the repetition. Here we have the repetition. Can we reduce this? Is there a way to optimize this program? We will understand this while studying the do while loop in the next topic. For now we are done with the while loop. This means we are done with the third topic as well. Now let's move to the fourth topic to understand the do while loop. Now what is the do while loop? Do while loop also allows us to execute a code block based on the condition. This means it works just like for and while loop but it executes the code block first and then the condition is checked. So it is bit different from the for loop and while loop. Here the condition is checked after executing the code block. This means the code block will execute at least once. And it is mainly used when the number of iterations are not known in advance just like the while loop. Now let's try to optimize the code which we have written before in case of while loop with the help of the do while loop. With the help of this do while loop we can reduce the repetition. Let's see how. Here is the same code we have written before. As I have mentioned this already we have the repetition over here. We can reduce this by using the do while loop. Understand what is happening here. We want to check a specific condition in the while loop. Now this condition depends on the user's choice. This means we need to ask the user to enter the choice first and then the condition must be checked. And after checking the condition we need to again ask the user to enter the choice when the condition turns out to be true. This type of situation can easily be handled by the do while loop because in do while loop we can check a specific condition after executing the code block. So here we can replace this while loop by do while loop. For this purpose we do not need these two statements so we can remove them. Now we have this while loop. We can replace this by do while loop. We need to shift this while statement to the bottom after this closing brace like this. And we need to place a semicolon here. Now we can specify the do keyword here. So now we have the do while loop. This is how the do while loop looks like. Here these statements will execute at least once. First these statements will execute. This means we will ask the user to enter the choice. We will receive the choice in the choice variable. Then after this the condition is checked. This is the order that is followed here. Now if the condition is true then the choice will be asked again. Otherwise we will exit this do while loop and this message will be displayed. So this code will work exactly the same as the code we saw in case of the while loop. And here also we will get the similar output. I hope this concept is clear to you. We have optimized our code. We have reduced the repetition. This block of code has been written just once because of the do while loop. So with this we have understood the do while loop as well and we now know what's the importance of the do while loop. So with this we are done with the fourth topic and this means we are done with all the topics of this lecture. Okay friends this is it for now. Thank you for watching this presentation. I will see you in the next one.",
