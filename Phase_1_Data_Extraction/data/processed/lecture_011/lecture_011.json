      "text": " In the last presentations, we solved four problems on bigot notation. Now, in this lecture, we will solve two more problems on bigot notation. This is set number three on bigot notation solved problems. So, let's get started and let's see what are the topics. In this lecture, we will solve two problems on bigot notation. So, let's proceed. The problem number one is, find the upper bound for fn equal to 2n cube minus 2n square. I want you to pause this video for a while and try to solve this problem on your own. I hope you're done. Let's solve this problem together. In the last presentation, I proposed the three step method to solve these type of problems. The step number one is to find the dominant term first. The step number two is to assume some gn according to the dominant term. And step number three is to apply the bigot definition. So, now let's follow the same three step method to solve this problem. So, here is the solution. First, we need to find the dominant term. The dominant term in this expression is clearly 2n cube because 2n cube is greater than 2n square. Therefore, the dominant term is 2n cube. Now, what about the gn? Step number two is to assume some gn according to the dominant term. Now, let's assume that gn is equal to n cube as it can be the least upper bound for 2n cube. We can assume some constant c may be equal to 2 or greater than 2 and this might become the least upper bound for 2n cube and this entire expression. So, we are assuming that gn is equal to n cube. Now, let's apply step number three. According to step number three, we need to apply the bigot definition. So, now let's apply the definition of bigot notation. According to the definition of bigot notation, fn is equal to bigot of gn if and only if fn is less than or equal to c dot gn for all values of n where n is greater than or equal to n naught and c and n naught are constants. Let us assume some value of c. Let's say c is equal to 2. We are assuming c to be 2 because it is my intuition that 2n cube will surpass at some point 2n cube minus 2n square as we are subtracting 2n square from 2n cube in fn. So, is it true that fn is less than or equal to c dot gn or 2n cube minus 2n square is less than or equal to 2n cube? Let's find out. Let's draw the table for fn which is 2n cube minus 2n square and c dot gn which is 2n cube. Now, let's plug in the values of n one by one. Let us assume that n is equal to one. If n is equal to one, then 2n cube minus 2n square will be equal to zero because as n is one, this becomes 2 minus 2 and 2 minus 2 is equal to zero. What about this expression? If we plug in the value of n which is equal to one here, we will get 2 into 1 which is equal to 2. We can observe that for n equal to one, c dot gn is greater than fn. Now, let's take n equal to 2. If n is 2, this expression becomes 8 and this expression becomes 16. At this point also, we can observe that c dot gn is greater than fn. What if we take n equal to 3? This expression becomes 36 and this expression becomes 54. If we take n as 4, we will get 96 here and we will get 128 here. We can observe that if n is greater than or equal to one, c dot gn becomes greater than fn. So, clearly n naught is equal to one and this means that this expression is true. 2n cube minus 2n square is indeed less than or equal to 2n cube when n naught is equal to one. So, we can say that 2n cube minus 2n square is equal to big O of n cube for c equal to 2 and n naught equal to one. We are getting big O of n cube here because gn is n cube. So, n cube is the upper bound of fn. So, with this I hope it is clear how to solve these type of problems. Now, let's proceed and solve problem number 2. Problem number 2 says, find the upper bound for fn equal to n to the power of 4 plus 100n square plus 35. Again, I want you to solve this problem on your own. For this, please pause the video and try solving this problem. I hope you are done. Let's solve this problem using the same three step method. Step number 1 is to find the dominant term in this expression. What do you think? What is the dominant term in this expression? Clearly, it is n to the power of 4. Because n to the power of 4 is greater than 100n square and it is also greater than 35. Therefore, the dominant term in this expression is n to the power of 4. What about gn? We know step number 2 is to assume some gn according to the dominant term. Let's say gn is equal to n to the power of 4. It is always a good idea to assume gn closer to the dominant term because we want to know the least upper bound of fn. Not only upper bound but least upper bound. Although in the question it is written, find the upper bound. So, let us assume gn is equal to n to the power of 4. Now, let's apply the big O definition. According to step number 3, we now need to apply the big O definition. According to the definition of big O notation, fn is equal to big O of gn if and only if fn is less than or equal to c dot gn. For all values of n where n is greater than or equal to n naught and c and n naught are constants. Now, what is fn? fn is n to the power of 4 plus 100 n square plus 35. And we are assuming gn to be equal to n to the power of 4. If this is true, then fn less than or equal to c dot gn must be true. Let us assume c is equal to 2. We are assuming c to be 2. And this means that we want to find out whether n to the power of 4 plus 100 n square plus 35 is less than or equal to 2n to the power of 4 or naught. Is it true? What do you think? I want you to draw the table for fn and c dot gn. I want you to plug in the values of n and identify the value n naught. And this means I want you to prove that 2n to the power of 4 is indeed greater than or equal to n to the power of 4 plus 100 n square plus 35. Or in other words, prove that n power 4 is the upper bound of fn. So, this will be your homework. I hope with these the problems are clear. And this means we are done with this presentation. Okay friends, this is it for now. Thank you for watching this presentation. I will see you in the next one.",
